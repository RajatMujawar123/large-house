            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Kickstarter is specifically for creative projects in the following categories: Art, Comics, Crafts,
                    Dance, Design, Fashion, Film & Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing,
                    Technology, and Theater. Make an album, write a book, create an immersive theater experience, score
                    a film — you name it. Read more about our project guidelines.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Millions of people visit Kickstarter every week, but support always begins with people you know.
                    Friends, fans, and the communities you’re a part of will likely be some of your earliest supporters,
                    not to mention your biggest resources for spreading the word about your project..</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Every Kickstarter project has its share of exhilarating and challenging moments, but the amount of
                    work generally depends on the size and complexity of the project.</p>
                <p class="paraextraMRS">Expect the first few days after launch to be very busy as you spread the word to
                    your community,
                    answer questions from potential backers, and more. You may need to spend the last few days rallying
                    your social networks in order to reach your funding goal.</p>
                <p class="paraextraMRS">Projects sometimes take on a life of their own, and in that case you should
                    expect to spend more time
                    creating and fulfilling rewards.</p>

                    gives backers incentive to pledge more to help you reach your goal.</p>

                    the creative curtain and directly supporting the creative process. In fact, 13.9 million people have
                    pledged more than $3.39 billion to bring Kickstarter projects to life over the years.</p>
